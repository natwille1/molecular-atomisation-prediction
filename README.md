## Project overview

This repository contains models and scripts to predict the molecular atomization energies of small compounds. 

### Implementation

The notebooks explore different representations of coulomb matrices and their impact on the performance of neural networks predicting molecular atomisation energies. The notebooks leverage DeepChem as the main library for model evaluation.
